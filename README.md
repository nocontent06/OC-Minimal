# Add Kext
When someone says "Use Whatevergreen" or "USBInjectAll",
all you need to do is:

1. Search the Kext (mostly on some GitHub Pages)
2. Download the latest Release
3. Unzip it
4. Paste the .kext file into your EFI/OC/Kexts Folder
5. Open config.plist and do a OC Snapshot (when you use ProperTree by CorpNewt)
